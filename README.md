# AI/ML Learning Roadmap with Python

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) using Python. It provides a structured roadmap, essential libraries, and projects to build practical skills.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into AI/ML, ensure you have a basic understanding of:
- Python (functions, loops, OOP, etc.)
- Linear Algebra and Statistics
- Probability and Calculus (Optional but useful)
- Basic Data Structures

## Setup
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras nltk
```

## Learning Roadmap
### 1. Python for Data Science
- NumPy: Arrays and mathematical operations
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

### 2. Machine Learning Basics
- Understanding Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM
- Model Evaluation (MSE, RMSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

### 3. Deep Learning
- Introduction to Neural Networks
- TensorFlow & Keras Basics
- Building simple ANN, CNN, RNN models

### 4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Tokenization and Text Preprocessing
- Sentiment Analysis
